The principles of mindfulness can also be applied to all aspects of our work, especially design work (in the broadest sense of the term, not just in the visual/graphic sense). A mindful approach to design intrinsically implies awareness and the necessary presence to design for inclusivity, accessibility, openness, and ethics, to add value to our daily practice, as well as to our final outcomes: a peaceful and prosperous way to make a difference in our life and in the lives of those who share our path.",

      "description": "Diversity and Inclusion are more than buzzwords - they are part of a greater call-to-action that involves radically re-interpreting the way we train, educate, recruit, hire, and staff teams. We all know that studies show diverse teams and companies are more productive, have less inbuilt bias, and report higher profit margins.\n\nTech education has a key role to play in this re-envisioning of our field. Many opportunities are missed to hire in a diverse way because of institutional bias. A lack of standards is often cited, somewhat defensively, as a reason to not hire school candidates. On the other hand, high-quality graduates fire back that they represent the very diversity tech so desperately needs, but no one is giving them a chance.\n\nCode schools and the tech industry lack perspective on each other. But it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nA former code school teacher and faculty lead for 3 years, Perry is on a mission to make tech more accessible and inclusive. If you are an engineer, hiring manager, community manager, advocate, or student, he invites you into an exploration of the present and future of tech/ed, the obstacles we face, and what we might change. Together, we’ll explore practical ways everyone, regardless of role, can help build a more diverse, accessible pipeline.
