According to the World Health Organization, there are over one billion people globally who need an assistive device. With these statistics, organizations and open source projects alike realize that they could be unintentionally locking these people out of their products. As a result, they adjust their developer workflows. And it often ends there, at the product. Documentation is left out of the conversation.\nIf documentation is meant to serve as a tool for learning and comprehension, then it must be included in those conversations. After all, we want to write docs that are truly for everyone — regardless of the technology they use to read it.\n\nIn this talk, we’ll look at how assistive technology consumes documentation and cover some points to consider when building out your docs. Along the way, we’ll touch on quick regulation wins and inclusive writing practices."},"actionsongoogle":{"speakers":["netomarin"],"title":"Creating an Action and helping your local community","language":"English","description":"There are several ways to support your community using technology, and during this workshop you will learn how to do this building an Action on Google for the Google Assistant.

Many opportunities are missed to hire in a diverse way because of institutional bias. A lack of standards is often cited, somewhat defensively, as a reason to not hire school candidates. On the other hand, high-quality graduates fire back that they represent the very diversity tech so desperately needs, but no one is giving them a chance.\n\nCode schools and the tech industry lack perspective on each other.

Felix will share some of his most inspiring moments in the tech community, but life is not a cinderella story: he will also reveal some of the many challenges he faces because of his age and because he is still going to school.","tags":[],"speakers":["felixwu"],"title":"Making a Difference: Experiences of a 17-year-old in the Tech Scene"},"sketchnoting":{"description":"Unleash your creativity while actively listening to talks! Sketchnoting is the art of using visuals to record and share ideas. Come to learn about taking notes, and how to make beautiful sketches with the help of lettering techniques.\n\nTaking notes in a visual way, while actively listening to talks, is an excellent way to remember the most important ideas and going back to them in the future. You can also use sketchnoting to share ideas at work or to organize your day.\nYou will learn sketchnoting techniques from us while making your first sketch! And as well, you will learn the basics of lettering, the art of writing beautiful captions. We will be also sketchnoting with you, sharing our process live!\n\nEveryone can get started with sketchnoting, you only need pen and paper!","tags":[],"speakers":["lariki","miqubel"],"title":"Sketchnoting & Lettering Workshop","language":"English"},"succeedonmobileweb":{"tags":[],"speakers":["annapotanina"],"title":"Succeed on Mobile Web: A/B-test, Design and Change","language":"English","description":"More and more companies are adopting agile approach to building user experience on websites based on A/B-testing methodologies. By using analytical tools developers, UX designers, product teams and marketers are trying to understand what users of mobile website need, what problems they face and how to solve them. They put forward hypotheses, test changes on the site and analyze whether it improves from the user point of view or not. This approach is especially important when it come to designing for mobile web: with the small screen size, it becomes much more difficult to put together functionality, brand attributes, promos, partner material, SEO content and to meet user expectations at the same time. Prioritisation here becomes key and this is where different goals of internal departments may not help the user experience.\n\nIn the short term, the way to increase conversions on mobile web is to study best practices and case studies.\n\nIn the long term, adoption of A/B-testing philosophy within the company leads to building the culture of growth and optimization where everyone is ready to discuss hypotheses, plan experiments, clearly interpret results, be prepared to fail, learn and continue testing on the everyday basis. With the development of Internet commerce this approach became relevant not only to IT companies, but also to absolutely all web players."},"tba":{"description":"Surprise! Stay tuned.","title":"To be announced!"},"testoftime":{"description":"One of the promises of test driven development is the confidence and ease with which we can refactor our production code.\n\nHowever, sometimes we find ourselves in a position where our tests are highly coupled to the production code and we have to change the tests every time we update our production code. At this point we start wondering if the tests we had are even worth it if we have to spend so much time to maintain them. If you have ever found yourself having to update your tests every time the behavior of a dependency of the class under test has changed, then this talk is for you.\n\nThis talk is to share with you some patterns, tools and examples that can guide us to write more maintainable tests.","tags":[],"speakers":["segunfamisa"],"title":"Writing Tests that Stand the Test of Time","language":"English"},"vrmap":{"tags":[],"speakers":["robertkaiser"],"title":"VR Map: Using OpenStreetMap Data in WebVR","language":"English","description":"Do you have to buy proprietary tools as well as data and be an expert programmer to create a virtual world? With a modern browser, Mozilla’s A-Frame library and OpenStreetMap data you don’t: See how Free Software, Open Standards and crowdsourced data let you walk or “fly” through a simple 3D map!"},"webassembly":{"speakers":["milicamihajlija"],"title":"WebAssembly: Binary in Plain English","language":"English","description":"The beauty of the web is that it works anywhere, no download and no installation. It has come a long way from text pages with links, but the only language that you could use to build applications for it was JavaScript - until now.\n\nThink about cases where you need to use software outside of the browser: video games, 3D rendering, music production and more. These things require a high degree of performance and that’s where WebAssembly steps in - a standardized compilation target for native languages. The support rolled out last year in all major browsers, and there are exciting real-world examples already.\n\nThis will be your gentle guide into what is WebAssembly, why we need it and how you can benefit from it in your next project (even if you continue to work with JavaScript only). The future is here now and it looks fast and bright.","tags":[]},"zeroadoption":{"tags":[],"speakers":["bratwurstkomet"],"title":"Zero Adoption: Lessons Learned From Failing at Open Source","language":"English","description":"I'd love to tell you a story about how the software I created helped my community. Sadly, I can't: nothing I built ever found an audience. This talk is about how I failed to reach a community, about why it doesn't matter - or rather: what I learned from being stuck in an open source team of one.\n\nFor years I was convinced that the success of an open source project was determined by the usefulness of the software. My imaginary blueprint of open sourcing was:\n1. Build something useful\n2. Open source it\n3. Everybody wins\n\nIt turns out that it is much harder than that. \n\nThis talk is about how I built several tools that would help the UX community to deliver awesome products with a great experience, while never finding an audience for the tools.  We'll look at all the mistakes one can make and what to do instead to build a thriving community. \n\nAnd even if you don't find an audience: Zero adoption does not mean zero value. We'll look at how there is great benefit in building and publishing things, if not for others then for yourselves."}}
