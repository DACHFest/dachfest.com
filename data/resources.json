Above all else, GDGs are groups of people passionate about technology and keen to share their excitement.<br /><br />Women Techmakers (WTM) are communities with a strong focus on improving diversity and inclusion. Events organized by WTM chapters are usually dedicated to solving the issues experienced by women and people from other underrepresented groups in tech, such as gaps in hiring and pay, bias, or misrepresentation.<br /><br />Every year, from August to November, most GDG and WTM chapters organize DevFests — large non-profit tech conferences focused on community building and learning about technology. No matter where you live, New York City or Siberia, there is probably a DevFest not too far away.<br/><br/>And of course, no matter where you live, we can't wait to welcome you at DACHFest!",
