At this point we start wondering if the tests we had are even worth it if we have to spend so much time to maintain them. If you have ever found yourself having to update your tests every time the behavior of a dependency of the class under test has changed, then this talk is for you.\n\nThis talk is to share with you some patterns, tools and examples that can guide us to write more maintainable tests.",

These things require a high degree of performance and that’s where WebAssembly steps in - a standardized compilation target for native languages. The support rolled out last year in all major browsers, and there are exciting real-world examples already.\n\nThis will be your gentle guide into what is WebAssembly, why we need it and how you can benefit from it in your next project (even if you continue to work with JavaScript only).

Living mindfully, designing mindfully, coding mindfully can be extremely rewarding, for us and for the beneficiaries of our work.\n\nWhile the notion of mindfulness has had a resurgence as a buzz word, its profound and most deep meaning goes beyond light meditation and coloring books. The principles of mindfulness can also be applied to all aspects of our work, especially design work (in the broadest sense of the term, not just in the visual/graphic sense). A mindful approach to design intrinsically implies awareness and the necessary presence to design for inclusivity, accessibility, openness, and ethics, to add value to our daily practice, as well as to our final outcomes: a peaceful and prosperous way to make a difference in our life and in the lives of those who share our path.",

This approach might work, but it is too chaotic and will eventually fail.\n\nInterviewing more than 200 potential candidates in a 5-month period is a lot.

Her story illustrates exactly this, and how challenges were overcome… for the love of tech.\n\nThis is the story of how a group of women, in a small city, with no opportunity to travel or see people of other cultures and abilities, combined their love for tech, to break the social and cultural barriers that surround them, and created events to share their passion with other women and teach them to aim high and not allow anything to stop them from achieving their dreams.",

Let’s make tech events more approachable and create good experience for everyone.\n\nEver visit a tech event on your own and tried to blend in with the wall, sweaty hands wrapped tightly around your cell phone, internal debating if you just should take a run for the door? Simultaneously hoping to meet new people and dreading someone could talk to you. Ever followed a conference through twitter hashtags, feeling sad, frustrated and angry at yourself that your were too scared to go?\n\nThat’s presumably around 13% of the people you know. People who describe themselves as shy, introverted or socially awkward. You can sum it up with one word: Social anxiety. Broadly speaking that’s the fear of social situations that involve interaction with other people.\n\nIn this talk Mirjam wants to share with you how she tries to be a solution to her own problem. Her project Conference Buddy wants to provide a platform to find companions for tech conferences. Mirjam wants to show you how we can support others to face their fears and give them opportunities to come into company, come to this intimidating, big tech conferences and make successful experiences with this awesome community.

User experience trumps technology.” Wouldn’t it be a win-win if developers care about users as much as designers are held responsible for? This talk is to highlight why it matters, adjusting expectations and areas to focus.\n\nWahib will share his learnings after several years as an Android Dev in product and consulting companies. Highlighting how this mindset of “I’m just a developer” can be toxic and realising that the whole team has (or should have) a common goal of building something that truly delights and adds value to the user. Why developers fail to develop empathy for their users? How “Be proactive, not reactive” approach goes a long way and has the solution to many problems.

      "description": "Diversity and Inclusion are more than buzzwords - they are part of a greater call-to-action that involves radically re-interpreting the way we train, educate, recruit, hire, and staff teams. We all know that studies show diverse teams and companies are more productive, have less inbuilt bias, and report higher profit margins.\n\nTech education has a key role to play in this re-envisioning of our field. Many opportunities are missed to hire in a diverse way because of institutional bias. A lack of standards is often cited, somewhat defensively, as a reason to not hire school candidates. On the other hand, high-quality graduates fire back that they represent the very diversity tech so desperately needs, but no one is giving them a chance.\n\nCode schools and the tech industry lack perspective on each other. But it doesn’t have to be this way.\n\nA former code school teacher and faculty lead for 3 years, Perry is on a mission to make tech more accessible and inclusive. If you are an engineer, hiring manager, community manager, advocate, or student, he invites you into an exploration of the present and future of tech/ed, the obstacles we face, and what we might change. Together, we’ll explore practical ways everyone, regardless of role, can help build a more diverse, accessible pipeline. You will walk away from this talk ready and equipped to help make a difference - by making tech & tech ed more accessible, more relevant, and more diverse!",
